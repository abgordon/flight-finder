# Flight Finder

I was planning a trip with a large group of friends and one of them had an interesting idea: instead of picking a city, why don't we just let a program sift `all of the cities` and pick the cheapest average flight to an arbitrary destination? The trip is about catching up anyway, and this path may lead to an interesting destination. We could even tally up the flight costs and all pay an equal portion, so the furthest person from the destination doesn't get shafted. This tool probably exists somewhere, but it's fun to play around with this stuff.

### TODO 12/21/2019:

- make it more configurable
